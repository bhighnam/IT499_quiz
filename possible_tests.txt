Team Awesome testing ideas: Developers Brian Highnam, Roberto Isidro, Michael Watkinson

-- Modeling tests --------

Test user inputs for user profile( e.g. email , password )

Make sure that the all of the fields are filled. If not, display error message "Please fill in all of the fields and try again".

Make sure that updates are insertion of new records is actually being done within the database. Reason why is because it may bring up unnecessary null values or create more errors.

Make sure that the database is able to take in stories with symbols( e.g. apostrophes , etc. ). Reason, some DBMSs need to have a special function to make it possible to put in symbols.

-- Design tests -----

( put design test stuff here )
